<!-- Here are some themes and techniques that we work on: -->

### Development of novel methods for computational microscopy
Thanks to the affiliation of the University of Chicago with the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, we have developed a number of collaborations that apply our expertise in inverse problems to the development of new computational microscopy approaches. One strand, in collaboration with Hari Shroff of NIH, involves developing novel approaches to modeling and fusing multi-view data in light-sheet microscopy, including a three-lens, three-view system and a mirror-based system to create orthogonal light sheets and capture four views of the sample. A second strand involves developing novel approaches to estimate the orientation of molecules that have been tagged rigidly with anisotropic fluorophores like GFP. At present, we are seeking to merge the two strands by developing novel multiview, light-sheet approaches to imaging of molecular orientation.

### Development of approaches for x-ray histology at cellular resolution
Histological studies providing cellular insights into tissue architecture have been central to biological discovery and remain clinically invaluable today. Extending histology to three dimensions would be transformational for research and diagnostics. However, three-dimensional histology is impractical using current techniques. We have customized sample preparation, synchrotron X-ray tomographic parameters, and three-dimensional image analysis to allow for complete histological phenotyping using whole larval and juvenile zebrafish. The resulting digital zebrafish can be virtually sectioned and visualized in any plane. Whole-animal reconstructions at subcellular resolution also enable computational characterization of the 50 zebrafish nervous system by region-specific cell nuclei detection and quantitative assessment of individual phenotypic variation. Three-dimensional histological phenotyping has potential use in genetic and chemical screens, and in clinical and toxicological tissue diagnostics. We are exploring the use of multi-stain, multi-energy techniques, allowing for “color” x-ray histology.

### Development of algorithms and novel imaging geometries for X-ray fluorescence tomography
We have worked for several years to develop new image reconstruction algorithms and new image acquisition strategies for X-ray fluorescence computed tomography (XFCT). X-ray fluorescence computed tomography (XFCT) is an emerging imaging modality that allows for the reconstruction of the distribution of nonradioactive elements (mostly metals) within a sample from measurements of fluorescence X-rays produced by irradiation of the sample. Many endogenous metals and metal ions, such as Fe, Cu, and Zn, play critical roles in signal transduction and reaction catalysis, while others (Hg, Cd, Pb) are quite toxic even in trace quantities.

XFCT is a stimulated emission tomography modality and thus correction for attenuation of the incident and fluorescence photons is essential if accurate images are to be obtained. We have developed three different attenuation-correction algorithms for XFCT, each more general and powerful than the last [1]. We have also proposed new data acquisition schemes to minimize attenuation [2].

In recent years, in collaboration with Ling-Jian Meng at UIUC, we have begun to explore radically different ways of measuring XFCT data. Our insight was to exploit the fact that X-ray fluorescence is a stimulated emission modality to perform selective illumination coupled with detection by pixelated cameras through collimating apertures to perform direct imaging without need for tomographic image reconstruction.

### Development of sinogram restoration strategies for computed tomography
We have a long-standing research program in sinogram restoration for computed tomography.My group has developed a novel strategy for CT data processing that entails application of a statistically principled penalized-likelihood estimation of the ideal, low-noise line integrals needed for image reconstruction from the noisy degraded transmission measurements [1]. The goal was to achieve some of the benefit of fully iterative reconstruction at a fraction of the computational cost. We collaborated with Philips Research and Development on this work [2] and some ideas were incorporated into Philips’ clinical iDose dose-reduction scheme. We showed that for quadratic penalties, we could achieve very similar performance to fully iterative reconstruction [3] and that edge-preserving penalties provided an improvement over quadratic penalties but could not match the performance of fully iterative reconstruction with edge preservation [4]. While computational power now supports the use of fully iterative in routine CT scans, there is still a role for the ideas of sinogram restoration in dynamic and spectral CT.

### Development of novel approaches to spectral CT
We have recently developed a number of algorithms for reconstructing images in spectral CT, with applications to both existing dual-energy systems and emerging photon-counting systems. In general, the algorithms seek to exploit the common structure expected in the raw data (among the images/sinograms acquired at different energies) or in the reconstructed basis-material images.

### Development of contrast agents and algorithms for optoacoustic tomography
Proteases represent a particularly appealing target for molecular imaging, as they are overexpressed in a number of pathologies. While there are fluorescently labeled probes for protease imaging, these suffer the limitations of all optical molecular imaging strategies. Reflecting on these limitations, we conceived of the idea of an optoacoustic imaging molecular probe sensitive to proteases, in which the molecule’s absorption peak would shift upon being cleaved by proteases [2].

In parallel with these chemical and experimental developments, our group has developed novel image reconstruction strategies aimed at accounting for and correcting acoustic inhomogeneities. For example, we developed and published the first method for modeling and correcting for acoustic attenuation in optoacoustic imaging [1]. Dimple Modgil has developed methods for correcting speed of sound variations, has evaluated novel linear geometry reconstruction algorithms, and optimizing wavelength choice in optoacoustic imaging [3,4].

One of the  projects back from my job-proposal is to develop nanofabricated STM tips. The idea behind these “smart tips” is to use the technologies that were developed over decades in nanofabrication and make them available for scanning probe by using a nano-device instead of the traditional STM tungsten tip. One gains the flexibility of using different functionalities that are known from the fields of nanofabrication and mesoscopic physics. We are collaborating with the group Simon Groeblacher at TU Delft to realize this concept, benefitting from their unparalleled micro/nano fabrication know how.  A prototype of a smart tip is shown to the left. See publications in Microsyst Nanoeng, Nanotechnology, and PRB. -->
